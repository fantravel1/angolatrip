## 🌍 Overview

**AngolaTrip.com** is a trip-optimization megasite built to introduce Angola to the world as:

> **one of Africa’s most visually dramatic, road-trip-ready, culturally rich countries — and one of the least understood.**

This is not a cliché Africa travel site.  
This is not poverty tourism.

AngolaTrip positions Angola as:
- coastal beauty  
- desert meets ocean  
- waterfalls  
- cities with soul  
- music culture  
- Portuguese + African fusion  
- epic road trips  

This is how Angola becomes real and magnetic.

- safe to plan  
- visually unforgettable

- a waterfall country  
- a highland country  
- a music culture country  
- a Portuguese-speaking Africa country  
- a road-trip country
