        <h2 id="faq-title">Seasonal FAQ</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Can I visit during rainy season?</summary>
          <p>Yes, but with caveats. Main highways (EN10, EN20) usually passable. Secondary roads often impassable. Waterfalls are spectacular. Plan for flexibility and get an experienced driver. Budget travel works here; premium travel doesn't.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if I can only visit November–April?</summary>
          <p>Avoid mid-December through mid-January if possible (peak rain). November and April are transition months and somewhat OK. Expect adventure; book with flexible cancellation. Hire a driver experienced in rainy conditions.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>When are waterfalls at their best?</summary>
          <p>March–May. Kalandula Falls is most impressive April–May. By July, flow diminishes. September onward, many falls are minimal. Plan accordingly if waterfalls are your priority.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is August really that busy?</summary>
          <p>Yes, it's peak European summer vacation. Book accommodations weeks in advance. June and July are also busy but slightly more flexible. September offers better availability with still-great weather.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>When is it cheapest?</summary>
          <p>December–March (rainy season). Expect 30–50% lower prices. Trade-off: roads less reliable, fewer tourists, lush landscape, higher malaria risk. Works for budget travelers with flexible itineraries.</p>
